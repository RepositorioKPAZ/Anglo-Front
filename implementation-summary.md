# Multi-Document Support Implementation

## Overview

We've transformed the `DocumentStatusCell` component from supporting a single document per row to supporting multiple documents. This implementation allows users to continue adding PDF files to a row while maintaining individual control over each document.

## Key Changes Made

### Frontend Changes

1. **State Management**

   - Replaced single document state with an array of documents
   - Updated deleting state to track deletion by document ID
   - Added utility function for formatting file sizes

2. **API Interactions**

   - Modified `checkDocument()` to handle an array of documents
   - Updated `handleUpload()` to add to existing documents rather than replacing
   - Enhanced `handleDelete()` to target specific documents by ID
   - Adjusted `handleDownload()` and `handleView()` to work with document filenames

3. **UI Improvements**

   - Added document counter badge when multiple documents exist
   - Created scrollable list for documents with improved styling
   - Added total file size display
   - Enhanced individual document cards with additional metadata
   - Made buttons more compact and user-friendly
   - Ensured the upload button is always available regardless of existing documents

4. **User Experience**

   - Truncated long filenames with tooltips for better readability
   - Added hover states for document cards
   - Made the dropdown wider for better content display
   - Maintained the familiar paperclip icon but added a count badge

5. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Added support for both old and new API response formats
   - Implemented fallback logic for each API operation
   - Enhanced error handling for all document operations
   - Added file size validation for uploads (max 10MB)

### Backend Requirements

The backend API must be updated to support:

1. **Retrieving multiple documents** for a single row
2. **Uploading new documents** to be added to a row's collection
3. **Deleting specific documents** by ID while preserving others
4. **Downloading/viewing specific documents** by filename

Detailed backend API specifications and migration guidelines are provided in the `backend-notes.md` file.

## Migration Strategy

To ensure a smooth transition:

1. **Implement Backend Changes First**

   - Update database schema to support multiple documents
   - Migrate existing document data
   - Ensure API endpoints support both old and new formats

2. **Deploy Frontend Changes**

   - The updated component handles both API formats
   - UI gracefully adapts to single or multiple documents

3. **Testing Phase**

   - Verify correct handling of existing single documents
   - Confirm ability to add multiple documents to the same row
   - Test individual document operations

4. **Full Rollout**
   - After successful testing, complete the migration
   - Monitor for any issues during the transition period

## Testing Considerations

When testing this implementation, verify:

1. Documents can be uploaded repeatedly to the same row
2. Each document can be individually viewed, downloaded, and deleted
3. The UI correctly shows the number of documents
4. Document deletions only remove the specific document
5. The UI handles a large number of documents appropriately with scrolling
6. **Backward compatibility** works with existing documents
7. **Error handling** functions correctly for edge cases

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements include:

1. Drag-and-drop file upload support
2. Multi-file selection for uploading multiple documents at once
3. Search/filter functionality for rows with many documents
4. Preview thumbnails for PDF documents
5. Categorization or tagging of documents
